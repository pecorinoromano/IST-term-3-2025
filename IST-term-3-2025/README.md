**- study reminder app**
- tracking/fitness app

# to make a study/item reminder app (functional requirements):
- be able to input what you want to be reminded about
- to be able to set a reminder timer to a certain time and date
- and if there is time, make folders to seperate it into different categories to make it neater

  # non funtional requirements
  - different colours for folders
  - the reminders pop up whenever
  - simple, easy to look at
  - shared? you can maybe share one reminder with another person perhaps

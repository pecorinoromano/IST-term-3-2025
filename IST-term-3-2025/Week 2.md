| Wireframe | How things connect, how things interact, and how they function. | <img width="906" height="627" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9725f77-e9ca-4eca-84da-eb01cc1ce6db" />
| Colour Palette | The colour palette is the theme of my website/app, and I used coolors to generate the colour palette. The warm colours are inviting. | <img width="1903" height="636" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a94f2473-e07c-4549-903d-6a00de77e3b1" /> | 
| Icon Choice | I chose a simple logo for my website, that both looked aesthetic yet presented it's purpose clearly. | <img width="361" height="369" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de2d4f14-0ddb-40c6-8601-b5ba69274069" /> |
| Typography | I used the Biski font as my main font - I'm not sure whether I'm going to keep it yet, but it seems pretty good for now. | <img width="760" height="821" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d3516a-72cd-441b-8e7c-445da6dcc659" /> |

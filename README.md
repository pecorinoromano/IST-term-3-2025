# IST-term-3-2025
ist assessment task term 3

# Week 1: 
ideas:
**- study reminder app**
- tracking/fitness app

# to make a study/item reminder app (functional requirements):
- be able to input what you want to be reminded about
- to be able to set a reminder timer to a certain time and date
- and if there is time, make folders to seperate it into different categories to make it neater

  # non functional requirements
  - different colours for folders
  - the reminders pop up whenever
  - simple, easy to look at
  - shared? you can maybe share one reminder with another person perhaps

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| be able to input what you want to be reminded about | different colours for folders | 
| to be able to set a reminder timer to a certain time and date | the reminders connect to your computer and pop up whenever |
| Users are able to change the background/theme | visuals should be high-quality | 
| Users can set custom timer durations (eg. 25/5/15 mins) | App should work smoothly with no noticeable bugs or crashes |
|create folders to more clearly seperate things | you could share notifications and reminders with someone else |

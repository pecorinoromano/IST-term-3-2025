# Week 9
This week was focused on creating the interactive home page ("my day") and creating the interactive tasks page. This was one of the most difficult parts of the assessment, as adding interactive elements requires multiple steps in order to work, and you need to link one element to another. If you mess one thing up in _one_ part of it, you mess EVERYTHING up, which is incredibly frustrating. <br> <img width="1890" height="867" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-25 175416" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/319a9848-2af0-428a-98bb-a2f34c87e247" /> <br> the image above is my "my day" page, which as you can see has been drastically improved, as it now has tasks, dates and details, which correlates with my reminders/task section

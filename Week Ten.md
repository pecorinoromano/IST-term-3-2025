# Week 10
This week, I continued adding interactive elements onto my website. I added more interactivity into the "lists" section, as that was the last section that I needed to work on. <p> Firstly, though, I needed to edit the website, because I think the calendar is just too difficult to incorporate it into the website, and I have enough pages for a functional website. So I decided to remove the calendar, and focus on making the other pages of the websites better, more aesthetically pleasing, and more interactive. <br> <img width="969" height="811" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-12 183221" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2bebf3b-0014-4dcb-a0ea-1e9954c8f562" /> <br> the lists section wasn't too difficult to add on, as once i finished the other interactive elements, coding became much easier once.

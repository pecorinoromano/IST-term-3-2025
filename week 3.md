# Alternate Design
| Title | Details | Image |

| Wireframe (alternate) | How things connect, how things interact, and how they function. | <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Wireframe Flowchart Whiteboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bf38719-b1d2-4a25-9d14-f41898b64725" />
| Colour Palette | This is the alternate colour of the app, I decided to go with the complete opposite of the colour of the orginal design for variation. | <img width="1917" height="702" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-07 112025" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78033281-c091-4381-90b7-a3e3da321209" /> | 
| Logo Design | This icon stayed the same, because the icon does't change, but the colour scheme changed to match with the aesthetics and background. | <img width="425" height="174" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d235fcb-0218-492a-84a3-4e6e0c30b28d" />|
| Typography | I still used the Biski font as my main font - I'm still not sure whether I'm going to keep it yet, but it seems pretty good for now. | <img width="760" height="821" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d3516a-72cd-441b-8e7c-445da6dcc659" /> |
| Details | I changed the placement of certain buttons, such as the side bar and such, and I also changed the button arrangements. | This picture can be seen in to first row, in the wireframe). |

# Things to improve:
- pre-made icon for simplicity and ease
- find a better background (rather than solid, hard colour)

# Alternate Design
| Title | Details | Image |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Wireframe (alternate) | How things connect, how things interact, and how they function. | <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Wireframe Flowchart Whiteboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bf38719-b1d2-4a25-9d14-f41898b64725" />
| Colour Palette | This is the alternate colour of the app, I decided to go with the complete opposite of the colour of the orginal design for variation. | <img width="1917" height="702" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-07 112025" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78033281-c091-4381-90b7-a3e3da321209" /> | 
| Icon Choice | I chose a simple logo for my website, that both looked aesthetic yet presented it's purpose clearly. This icon stayed the same, because the icon does't change | <img width="361" height="369" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de2d4f14-0ddb-40c6-8601-b5ba69274069" /> |
| Typography | I still used the Biski font as my main font - I'm still not sure whether I'm going to keep it yet, but it seems pretty good for now. | <img width="760" height="821" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d3516a-72cd-441b-8e7c-445da6dcc659" /> |
| Details | I changed the placement of certain buttons, such as the side bar and such, and I also changed the button arrangements. | This picture can be seen in to first row, in the wireframe). |

# Things to improve:
- pre-made icon for simplicity and ease
